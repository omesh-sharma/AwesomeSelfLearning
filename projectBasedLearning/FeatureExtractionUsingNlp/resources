# Also we can use other tool :
Spacy-Label-Studio

 # Lable setdio used by the datascience to make the training data : 
 https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio

, you can use one of the following data annotation tools to create your own:
Doccano
Tagtog
LightTag
Prodigy

** issued i faced during installtiopno f docanno : djangorestframework : uninstall and isntall using python -m install , drf-yasg related uninstall and install the same with python -m pip install drf-yasg

some time spacy isue while training the data L in that case uninstall spacy and install again using the python -m 

 # approach 
 - Data set creation 
 - use rephrase on existing data  make sure to match the format
 - number and character to words
 - setup and install prodigy
 - check how to train with prodgy and use trained file
 - train teh file and see the result
 - search for the prepaid plan in the telco

 Telco prepaid plans
ChatGPT
Sure! Here are some examples of prepaid plans offered by telecommunications companies (telcos). Please note that these plans may vary depending on your location and the specific telco:
AT&T (United States):
Prepaid Monthly Plans: These plans offer unlimited talk, text, and data with various data speed options.
Pay-As-You-Go: Allows you to pay for minutes, texts, and data as you use them.
Vodafone (Global):
Vodafone Pay As You Go: Offers flexible rates for calls, texts, and data with the option to choose from various bundles.
Combo Prepaid: Provides a combination of minutes, texts, and data in a single bundle.
Airtel (India):

Airtel Smart Recharge: Offers a prepaid plan with a fixed validity period and a combination of talk time, data, and SMS benefits.
Airtel Unlimited Packs: Provides unlimited calls, daily data allowance, and SMS benefits for a fixed duration.
Optus (Australia):
Prepaid Epic Data: Offers a range of prepaid plans with different data allowances, unlimited standard national calls and texts, and additional features like data rollover and entertainment bonuses.
Prepaid Long Expiry: Provides a longer validity period for your prepaid credit, with the flexibility to recharge as needed.
Globe Telecom (Philippines):
GoSakto: Allows you to customize your own prepaid plan by choosing the amount of data, calls, and texts that suit your needs.
GoUNLI: Offers unlimited calls, texts, and data for a fixed duration.
EE (United Kingdom):
Pay As You Go: Offers various packs with different allowances for minutes, texts, and data.
Everything Pack: Provides unlimited minutes and texts with a fixed data allowance.
Remember to check with your local telco provider for the most up-to-date and accurate information on their prepaid plans. The plans may change over time, and different telcos may have different offerings.





Python code to create synthetic data based on mentioned example





# Process for creation of nlp custom ner and all
- First created sample text with harcoded substring in the spacy foromat suported
- then trained the custom model.
- I Used docanno to create manual data substring with labels.
- Then i create syntehtic data based on the understading and random combination to string to create plans and all.
- After that i combine all data set and make script to create data set synteic based on entereed daat set required.
- Then i TRain the model.
- After created UI and dsiplay result from that


# Meeting with chintan , september 3 2023 
- Chintan will share the further well prepare excel sheet with more fine tune data. On the top of that i have to create well written data set.
- Look for LAMA by facebook,  https://research.facebook.com/publications/llama-open-and-efficient-foundation-language-models/
- Look for BERT model, we can use this one to train NER as alternate of the spacy

Ian note : But what is their concern about "stable"? You can't have "balanced" and "stable" ... one or the other. In order to restore balance after any recovery of an EMGW you must have some "instability"... so you can control how much "stability" you have by modifying the refresh_interval.
It would be good to raise a documentation bug as well as part of the closure of this so that customers are aware of the behaviour.
Well spotted... this sort of things happens with code like this ... really, there should be a single function that returns a qualified list of host/port candidates to this logic... then it could just iterate the list...
Needs refactoring.

                    15.0 branch setup and intergration the same changes there first, then move to ps7 the same changes (for 15.o have to be carefull as ssl changes are already been integrated there , so have to verify that)

             For 15.0, SSL is supported in Pipeline so some of the changes will be different
             Dropping connections in the middle of transactions when refresh_interval

             Ian note : need to raise the seperate bug on this:
              P.S. I noticed whilst testing failures of discounting that all things failover without particular trouble now… but if you try and STOP the IFW it causes a lot of trouble as it appears to shutdown it’s pipelines before dropping connectivity… so you get lots of PIN_ERR_BAD_OPCODE and failures as a result…. Effectively, we can’t do a clean scale down of RTP currently… best to just kill -9… I will raise a bug about this…

             Testing adn debug
                HA configuration support confirmation
                Keep logs and result of qijs load and all, make a doucment on how we test and validate the strategy
                Making sure EM connections (EAI_JS in particular) do an SSH handshake on reconnect… they were currently reconnecting, but then failing as SSH was not initialized.
                Refresh interval in eijs should not be disconnect the running transaction
                Avoid the connection retries counter being reset
                Make sure in normal configuration connection should be balanced.
                Make sure that if pcp_conn_try_this fails the ebuf is reset (rather than in the loop for pcp_connect) so that a successful connect to another server does not return error
